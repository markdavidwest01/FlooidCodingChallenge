Input is placed in the "input.txt" file. It is formatted as such: the number of Peaches purchased (space) the number of Avocados purchased (space) the number of Mangos purchased. For example, if you were buying 4 peaches, 5 avocados, and 6 mangos, the file would look like so:

4 5 6

The resulting total price is printed in the console upon completion. The file does not take more than one line of input.
